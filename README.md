## Obsidian Sync RemoteStorage

This plugin aims to:

> Step1

-   Get list of vault contents
-   Upload vault contents to remoteStorage

> Step2

-   Retrieve and sync/merge vault contents FROM remoteStorage.
    -   For this, look into how obisidian-livesync performs diffs/merges

> Step 3, 0auth from plugin? or atleast link to site to get 0auth code

> Step 4, once basic up/down links and auth are setup, look into adding toggles for public/nonpublic notes
